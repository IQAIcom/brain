Brain Framework seamlessly integrates with ElizaOS's ecosystem through three main component types: database adapters, client interfaces, and plugins.

## Database Adapters

Brain Framework supports multiple database solutions through ElizaOS adapters. These adapters provide persistent storage,  vector search capabilities with different characteristics to match your deployment needs.

## Client Interfaces

Client interfaces enable your agent to communicate across various platforms. Each client handles platform-specific features and authentication, allowing your agent to interact through popular messaging and social media services.

## Core Plugins

ElizaOS plugins extend your agent's capabilities with specific features and integrations. From essential functionality to specialized services like blockchain integration, image generation plugins provide modular enhancements to your agent.

## Integration Example

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder, ModelProviderName } from "@iqai/agent";
import { SqliteDatabaseAdapter } from "@elizaos/adapter-sqlite";
import { DiscordClientInterface } from "@elizaos/client-discord";
import { createBootstrapPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-bootstrap";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

async function main() {
  // Initialize database
  const databaseAdapter = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter(
    new Database("./data/db.sqlite")
  );

  // Create agent with integrations
  const agent = new AgentBuilder()
    .withDatabase(databaseAdapter)
    .withClient("discord", DiscordClientInterface)
    .withPlugin(createBootstrapPlugin())
    .withModelProvider(
      ModelProviderName.OPENAI,
      process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    )
    .build();

  await agent.start();
}
```
