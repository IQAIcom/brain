The ABI plugin provides a dynamic way to interact with any Ethereum-compatible smart contract by generating actions from the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI). This plugin automatically creates callable actions for both read and write functions defined in the ABI.

## Installation

<Steps>
1. Install the required packages:
   <PackageManagers pkg="@iqai/plugin-abi" />

2. Create a `.env` file with required configuration:
   ```env
   WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
   ```
   <Aside type="danger" title="Security Warning">
   Never commit your `.env` file or share your private key. Anyone with access to your private key can control your wallet and funds. Make sure to:
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
   - Never share your private key in any form
   - Use a dedicated development wallet with limited funds
   </Aside>
</Steps>

## Basic Setup

Here's how to set up an agent with the ABI plugin:

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder, ModelProviderName } from "@iqai/agent";
import { createAbiPlugin } from "@iqai/plugin-abi";
import YourABI from "yourABI";
import { fraxtal } from "viem/chains";

async function main() {
  // Initialize ABI plugin
  const abiPlugin = await createAbiPlugin({
    abi: YourABI,
    contractName: "name-of-contract",
    contractAddress: "address-of-contract",
    description: "description-of-contract",
    privateKey: process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,
    chain: fraxtal, // Optional, defaults to Fraxtal chain
  });

  // Create agent with plugin
  const agent = new AgentBuilder()
    .withModelProvider(
      ModelProviderName.OPENAI,
      process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
    )
    .withPlugin(abiPlugin)
    .build();

  await agent.start();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## How It Works

The ABI plugin works by:
1. Analyzing the provided contract ABI
2. Extracting function definitions (both read and write)
3. Generating corresponding actions for each function
4. Automatically handling parameter parsing and response formatting

## Available Operations

The plugin dynamically creates actions based on the ABI functions provided. Each function in the ABI is transformed into an action with the naming pattern `CONTRACT_NAME_FUNCTION_NAME`.

### Example ERC20 Actions

When using the plugin with an ERC20 contract, the following actions would be automatically created:

| Action Name | Description | Function Type |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `ERC20_BALANCE_OF` | Check token balance | Read function |
| `ERC20_TRANSFER` | Transfer tokens | Write function |
| `ERC20_APPROVE` | Approve token spending | Write function |
| `ERC20_TRANSFER_FROM` | Transfer tokens from another address | Write function |
| `ERC20_ALLOWANCE` | Check spending allowance | Read function |
| `ERC20_TOTAL_SUPPLY` | Get total token supply | Read function |

## Usage Examples

Here's how to interact with your ABI-enabled agent:

### Querying Token Balance

Query:
```
What's the balance of 0x1234...5678?
```

The agent will parse this query, identify the address, and call the appropriate contract function (balanceOf).

Response:
```
✅ Successfully called balanceOf

Result: "1000000000000000000"
```

### Transferring Tokens

Query:
```
Transfer 10 tokens to 0x1234...5678
```

The agent will parse this query, extract the amount and recipient address, and execute the transfer function.

Response:
```
✅ Successfully executed transfer

Transaction hash: 0x123abc...

You can view this transaction on the blockchain explorer.
```

## Configuration Options

The ABI plugin accepts these configuration parameters:

```typescript
interface AbiPluginOptions {
  abi: any[];                           // Smart contract ABI
  contractName: string;                 // Name for the contract (used in action names)
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`;       // Contract address
  description: string;                  // Description for the plugin
  privateKey: string;                   // Private key for transactions
  chain?: Chain;                        // Optional: blockchain network (defaults to Fraxtal)
}
```

## Error Handling

The plugin handles various error scenarios:

- **Invalid function arguments**
  ```
  ❌ Error parsing arguments: Expected number, got string
  ```

- **Transaction execution failures**
  ```
  ❌ Error with transfer: execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance
  ```

- **Network connection issues**
  ```
  ❌ Error with balanceOf: network connection failed
  ```

## Best Practices

1. **Store private keys securely**: Never hardcode private keys in your application code. Always use environment variables.
2. **Use proper error handling**: Implement try/catch blocks around plugin initialization and usage.
3. **Test with testnets first**: Before using the plugin with mainnet contracts, test thoroughly on testnet networks.
4. **Validate ABIs**: Ensure that the ABI you provide is valid and complete.
5. **Handle gas efficiently**: For write functions, be aware of gas costs and implement proper error handling for insufficient gas scenarios.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Invalid ABI Format**: Ensure your ABI is correctly formatted JSON
- **Contract Address Format**: The contract address must be a valid Ethereum address starting with "0x"
- **Function Not Found**: Verify that the function you're trying to call exists in the ABI
- **Transaction Failures**: Check for sufficient balance and proper permissions

<Aside>
The ABI plugin is compatible with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that works with the viem library, including Ethereum, Fraxtal, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and more.
