The NEAR Plugin provides a seamless integration with the NEAR Protocol blockchain, enabling smart contract interactions, transaction handling, and event listening capabilities directly from your agent.

## Installation

Install the plugin using your preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm add @iqai/plugin-near
```


## Usage

Initialize and configure the NEAR plugin in your agent setup:

```tsx
import createNearPlugin from "@iqai/plugin-near";
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/agent";

// Initialize the plugin
const nearPlugin = await createNearPlugin({
  accountId: process.env.NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID,
  accountKey: process.env.NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY,
  listeners: [
    {
      eventName: "run_agent",
      contractId: "your-contract.testnet",
      responseMethodName: "agent_response",
      handler: async (payload, { account }) => {
        // Custom event handling logic
        return "result";
      },
    }
  ],
  networkConfig: {
    networkId: "testnet", // or "mainnet"
    nodeUrl: "https://test.rpc.fastnear.com",
  },
});

// Add the plugin to your agent
const agent = new AgentBuilder()
  // other configurations
  .withPlugin(nearPlugin)
  .build();
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables:

| Variable Name        | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID`    | Your NEAR account ID for authentication      |
| `NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY`   | Private key for your NEAR account            |

### Configuration Options

Below are all available configuration options for the NEAR plugin:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `accountId` | string | Yes | Your NEAR account ID for authentication |
| `accountKey` | string | Yes | Private key for your NEAR account |
| `listeners` | Array | Yes | Array of event listener configurations (see Event Listener Options table) |
| `gasLimit` | string | No | Default gas limit for transactions |
| `networkConfig.networkId` | string | No | Network ID ("testnet" or "mainnet") |
| `networkConfig.nodeUrl` | string | No | NEAR RPC endpoint URL |

### Event Listener Options

Each event listener in the `listeners` array accepts the following options:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `eventName` | string | Yes | Name of the event to listen for |
| `contractId` | string | Yes | Contract ID that emits the event |
| `handler` | Function | Yes | Function that processes the event and returns a response |
| `responseMethodName` | string | No | Contract method to call with the response |
| `cronExpression` | string | No | Optional cron schedule for timed events |

### Handler Context

The handler function receives two parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `payload` | any | Event data from the smart contract |
| `context` | Object | Context object containing the NEAR account |
| `context.account` | Account | NEAR account instance for making calls to contracts |


## Event-Driven AI Agents on NEAR

This plugin enables a powerful workflow for implementing AI agents that interact with NEAR blockchain smart contracts:

1. **Event Trigger**: A blockchain transaction triggers an event on a smart contract and pauses, waiting for input from an AI agent
2. **Agent Monitoring**: Your AI agent, powered by this plugin, monitors the blockchain for these specific events
3. **Computation**: When an event is detected, the agent performs AI-driven computations or analysis based on the event data
4. **Response Transaction**: The agent submits the result back to the blockchain via a transaction
5. **Contract Resumption**: The original smart contract receives the AI agent's response and continues its execution with this new data

This event-driven architecture enables "AI in the loop" systems where blockchain operations can incorporate intelligent decision-making at specific points in their execution.

Inside your handler functions, you can:
- Parse the incoming data
- Run AI inference or complex computations
- Call other NEAR contracts to gather additional data
- Return a result that will be automatically sent back to the original contract

## Use Cases

The NEAR Plugin enables numerous use cases for AI integration with blockchain:

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Price predictions, risk analysis, optimal trading paths
- **Gaming**: Intelligent NPCs, procedural content generation, dynamic difficulty adjustment
- **Content Creation**: On-chain verification of AI-generated assets or content
- **Governance**: Analysis of proposals and voting recommendations
- **Data Markets**: AI-powered data validation and enrichment services

## Error Handling

When implementing event handlers, proper error handling is essential:

```tsx
try {
  // Your event processing logic
  const result = processData(payload);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Agent processing failed:", error.message);
  // Return a fallback value or rethrow depending on your requirements
}
```

## Best Practices

- Store your **NEAR account ID** and **private key** securely in environment variables
- Implement comprehensive **input validation** in your event handlers
- Design handlers to be **idempotent** when possible
- Add **timeout handling** for long-running event processor functions
- Log all **events** and **responses** for debugging purposes
- Test your agent thoroughly on testnet before **deploying** to mainnet
- Consider **gas costs** for response transactions in your design
- Implement **circuit breakers** to pause event handling if errors exceed thresholds

## Conclusion

The NEAR Plugin enables your agent to interact seamlessly with the NEAR blockchain, creating responsive AI agents that can participate in on-chain activities. This "AI in the loop" architecture opens up possibilities for building increasingly intelligent and responsive decentralized applications.
