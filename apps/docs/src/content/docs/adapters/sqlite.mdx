The **SQLite Adapter** provides embedded database functionality, ideal for development and single-instance deployments.

## Installation

<Steps>
1. Install required packages:
   <PackageManagers pkg="@iqai/adapter-sqlite" />
</Steps>

## Basic Setup

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/agent";
import { SqliteDatabaseAdapter } from "@iqai/adapter-sqlite";


const databaseAdapter = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter();

const agent = new AgentBuilder()
  .withDatabase(databaseAdapter)
  // ... other configuration
  .build();
```

## Key Features

- ✔️ Built-in caching
- ✔️ BLOB storage support
- ✔️ Zero setup requirements

## Storage Configuration

```typescript


// Basic configuration
const adapter = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter({
  dbPath: "./data/db.sqlite",
});
```

## Collections Structure

The adapter automatically manages these collections:
- `rooms`
- `participants`
- `accounts`
- `memories`
- `knowledge`

Additional metadata is stored as JSON within these collections.

## Best Practices

- ✔️ Use for development and testing
- ✔️ Monitor database file size
