In this guide, we'll create a basic AI agent using Brain Framework from scratch.

## Creating a New Project

<Steps>
1. Set up your project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p my-brain-agent/src && cd my-brain-agent # create project directory and navigate to it
   npm init -y && npx tsc --init # initialize package.json and tsconfig.json
   touch src/index.ts .env # create src/index.ts and .env files
   ```

2. Install the required Brain Framework packages:
   <PackageManagers pkg="@iqai/agent @elizaos/client-direct@0.1.9 dotenv @types/dotenv" />

3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```javascript
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
</Steps>


## Creating Your First Agent

To create an agent, you'll need three key components:

1. **LLM Model Provider**: Choose your preferred language model (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) that will power your agent's intelligence.
2. **Client Interface**: Select how users will interact with your agent. Brain Framework supports various client integrations including Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and more. In this example, we'll use the Direct client which provides HTTP endpoints for interaction.
3. **Prompts and Plugins**: Define your agent's behavior through prompts and extend functionality using plugins. In this quickstart example, we'll use the default prompts that come with the framework. For customizing prompts and adding plugins, check out [Agent Creation Guide](/getting-started/agent-creation).

<Steps>
1. Open `src/index.ts` in your favorite code editor and add the following code:
   ```javascript
      import DirectClientInterface from "@elizaos/client-direct";
      import { AgentBuilder, ModelProviderName } from "@iqai/agent";
      import dotenv from "dotenv";

      // Load environment variables
      dotenv.config();

      const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY as string;

      async function main() {
         // Create your agent with basic configuration
         const agent = new AgentBuilder()
            .withModelProvider(ModelProviderName.OPENAI, OPENAI_API_KEY)
            .withClient("direct", DirectClientInterface)
            .build();

         // Start your agent
         await agent.start();

         console.log("Agent is running! You can test it using the IQAI Console.");
      }

      main().catch(console.error);
   ```

2. Update your `package.json` to support ES modules:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node src/index.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your agent:
   <PackageManagers type="run" args="start" />


4. Test your agent:
   After starting your agent, visit [IQAI Console](https://console.iqai.com) to interact with it through a ready-to-use interface. This allows you to test your agent without building a custom client application.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic agent running, you can:

- Explore different [Model Providers](/guides/model-providers) to power your agent
- Add [Plugins](/guides/plugins) to extend your agent's functionality
- Customize your agent's [Prompts](/guides/prompts) to define specific behaviors
- Deploy your agent to a [production environment](/deployment/overview)
