In this guide, we'll create a basic AI agent using Brain Framework from scratch. Before we go further, ensure you have Nodejs installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).


<Aside type="caution">
   Node version should be >=23. Any version below 23 will not work.

## Using Brain Starter Template

The fastest way to get started is using our pre-configured starter template which has all the basic setup ready to go.

<Steps>
1. Clone the brain-starter repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IQAIcom/brain-starter.git my-brain-agent
   cd my-brain-agent
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   <PackageManagers type="install" />

3. Start the development server:
   <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

4. Test your agent:
   After starting your agent, visit [IQAI Console](https://console.iqai.com) to interact with it through a ready-to-use interface. This allows you to test your agent without building a custom client application.
</Steps>

## Creating a New Project From Scratch

If you prefer to set up your project from scratch, you can follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Set up your project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p my-brain-agent/{src,data} && cd my-brain-agent
   ```
2. Setup project
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```
   <PackageManagers pkg="typescript && npx tsc --init" dev/>

3. Create index and env file
   ```bash
   touch src/index.ts .env
   ```

4. Install the required Brain Framework packages:
   <PackageManagers pkg="@iqai/agent @elizaos/client-direct@0.25.6-alpha.1 @elizaos/adapter-sqlite@0.25.6-alpha.1 better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3 sharp dotenv" />

5. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```javascript
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
</Steps>


## Creating Your First Agent

To create an agent, you'll need three key components:

1. **LLM Model Provider**: Choose your preferred language model (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) that will power your agent's intelligence.
2. **Client Interface**: Select how users will interact with your agent. Brain Framework supports various client integrations including Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and more. In this example, we'll use the Direct client which provides HTTP endpoints for interaction.
3. **Prompts and Plugins**: Define your agent's behavior through prompts and extend functionality using plugins. In this quickstart example, we'll use the default prompts that come with the framework. For customizing prompts and adding plugins, check out [Agent Creation Guide](/getting-started/agent-creation).

<Steps>
1. Open `src/index.ts` in your favorite code editor and add the following code:
   ```javascript
   import { SqliteDatabaseAdapter } from "@elizaos/adapter-sqlite";
   import DirectClientInterface from "@elizaos/client-direct";
   import { AgentBuilder, ModelProviderName } from "@iqai/agent";
   import Database from "better-sqlite3";
   import dotenv from "dotenv";

   // Load environment variables
   dotenv.config();

   const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY as string;

   async function main() {
      const databaseAdapter = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter(
         new Database("./data/db.sqlite"),
      );

      // Create your agent with basic configuration
      const agent = new AgentBuilder()
         .withModelProvider(ModelProviderName.OPENAI, OPENAI_API_KEY)
         .withDatabase(databaseAdapter)
         .withClient("direct", DirectClientInterface)
         .build();

      // Start your agent
      await agent.start();

      console.log("Agent is running! You can test it using the IQAI Console.");
   }

   main().catch(console.error);
   ```

2. Update your `package.json` to support ES modules and scripts:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "node src/index.ts"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your agent:
   <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />


4. Test your agent:
   After starting your agent, visit [IQAI Console](https://console.iqai.com) to interact with it through a ready-to-use interface. This allows you to test your agent without building a custom client application.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic agent running, you can:

- Explore different options you can pass though [Agent](/getting-started/agent-creation)
- Add [Plugins](/plugins/overview) to extend your agent's functionality
- Create your own plugins using [Plugin Creation Guide](/getting-started/creating-plugins)
- Deploy your agent to a [production environment](/getting-started/deployment)
