In this guide, we'll create a basic AI agent using Brain Framework from scratch.

## Creating a New Project

<Steps>
1. Set up your project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p my-brain-agent/src && cd my-brain-agent
   ```

2. Setup typescript
   <PackageManagers pkg="typescript" args='&& npx tsc --init' dev/>

3. Create index and env file
   ```bash
   touch src/index.ts .env
   ```

3. Install the required Brain Framework packages:
   <PackageManagers pkg="@iqai/agent @elizaos/client-direct@0.1.9 @elizaos/adapter-sqlite@0.1.9 better-sqlite3 sharp dotenv" />
   <PackageManagers dev pkg="@types/better-sqlite3 tsx" />

4. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```javascript
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
</Steps>


## Creating Your First Agent

To create an agent, you'll need three key components:

1. **LLM Model Provider**: Choose your preferred language model (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) that will power your agent's intelligence.
2. **Client Interface**: Select how users will interact with your agent. Brain Framework supports various client integrations including Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and more. In this example, we'll use the Direct client which provides HTTP endpoints for interaction.
3. **Prompts and Plugins**: Define your agent's behavior through prompts and extend functionality using plugins. In this quickstart example, we'll use the default prompts that come with the framework. For customizing prompts and adding plugins, check out [Agent Creation Guide](/getting-started/agent-creation).

<Steps>
1. Open `src/index.ts` in your favorite code editor and add the following code:
   ```javascript
   import { SqliteDatabaseAdapter } from "@elizaos/adapter-sqlite";
   import DirectClientInterface from "@elizaos/client-direct";
   import { AgentBuilder, ModelProviderName } from "@iqai/agent";
   import Database from "better-sqlite3";
   import dotenv from "dotenv";

   // Load environment variables
   dotenv.config();

   const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY as string;

   async function main() {
      const databaseAdapter = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter(
         new Database("./data/db.sqlite"),
      );

      // Create your agent with basic configuration
      const agent = new AgentBuilder()
         .withModelProvider(ModelProviderName.OPENAI, OPENAI_API_KEY)
         .withDatabase(databaseAdapter)
         .withClient("direct", DirectClientInterface)
         .build();

      // Start your agent
      await agent.start();

      console.log("Agent is running! You can test it using the IQAI Console.");
   }

   main().catch(console.error);
   ```

2. Update your `package.json` to support ES modules and scripts:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your agent:
   <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />


4. Test your agent:
   After starting your agent, visit [IQAI Console](https://console.iqai.com) to interact with it through a ready-to-use interface. This allows you to test your agent without building a custom client application.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic agent running, you can:

- Explore different [Model Providers](/guides/model-providers) to power your agent
- Add [Plugins](/guides/plugins) to extend your agent's functionality
- Customize your agent's [Prompts](/guides/prompts) to define specific behaviors
- Deploy your agent to a [production environment](/deployment/overview)
