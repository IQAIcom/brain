import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

When you build an agent using the DirectClientInterface, you can interact with it through a web client interface. This guide will walk you through the testing process.

## Accessing the Web Interface

When your agent is running with DirectClientInterface (as shown in the example configuration), it automatically exposes a web interface where you can interact with your agent.

### Enable DirectClientInterface

When defining an agent make sure to include the `direct` client in the client list.

```typescript
  const agent = new AgentBuilder()
                    ...
                    .withClient("direct", DirectClientInterface) // ensure this is present
```
Run the app and you will see this in the console,

<Image src="/src/assets/test-agent/console.png" alt="console" height="500" width="800" />

You can access the the web interface with the link from the console, which looks like this

<Image src="/src/assets/test-agent/brain-console.png" alt="brain-console" height="1000" width="1200" />

You can access all your created agents from this client interface directly with ease

<Image src="/src/assets/test-agent/brain-console-chat.png" alt="agent-chat" height="1000" width="1200" />

## Common Testing Scenarios

1. Basic Conversation Flow
2. Plugin Command Testing
3. Response Format Validation
4. Character Consistency Check
