When you build an agent using the DirectClientInterface, you can interact with it through a web client interface. This guide will walk you through the testing process.

## Accessing the Web Interface

When your agent is running with DirectClientInterface (as shown in the example configuration), it automatically exposes a web interface where you can interact with your agent.

### Enable DirectClientInterface

When defining an agent make sure to include the `direct` client in the client list.

```typescript
  import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/agent"
  import { DirectClientInterface } from "@elizaos/client-direct"

  const agent = new AgentBuilder()
                    .withClient("direct", DirectClientInterface) // ensure this is present
```
Run the app and you will see this in the console,

```bash
[2025-02-11 09:58:28] INFO:

╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║       *~* Direct client initialized *~*    ║
║       you can test out your agents in:     ║
║           https://console.iqai.com         ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

You can access the the web interface with the link from the console, You can access all your created agents from this client interface directly with ease
