Brain provides a powerful web interface to test and interact with your agents. This guide shows you how to set it up and use it effectively.

<Aside type="caution">
  Your agent must have direct client enabled to use console.
  To enable, add it to your agent's client list:

  ```typescript
  import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/agent"
  import { DirectClientInterface } from "@elizaos/client-direct"

  const agent = new AgentBuilder()
                  .withClient(DirectClient)
  ```
</Aside>

## Using console.iqai.com

1. Start your agent with direct client enabled
2. Wait until you find this message in your console:

```bash
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║       *~* Direct client initialized *~*    ║
║       you can test out your agents in:     ║
║           https://console.iqai.com         ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

3. Visit console.iqai.com
4. Your agent will appear automatically in the interface
