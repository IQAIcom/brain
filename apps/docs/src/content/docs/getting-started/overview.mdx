## Introduction

Brain Framework is a developer-first toolkit for building AI agents with enhanced flexibility and type safety. Built on top of ElizaOS, it provides a TypeScript-first approach to agent configuration and development.

### Why Brain Framework?

While ElizaOS offers an excellent foundation for AI agents through character.json configurations, many developers seek more programmatic control and type safety in their agent development workflow. Brain Framework addresses this by providing:

- Code-based configuration with full TypeScript support
- Builder pattern for intuitive agent setup
- Enhanced developer experience with improved tooling
- Full compatibility with existing ElizaOS plugins
- Specialized core plugins for advanced functionality

### Key Features

- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Move beyond character.json with fully typed configuration options
- **Builder Pattern**: Intuitive API for constructing and configuring agents
- **Core Plugins**:
  - Heartbeat: Simplified cron job implementation
  - Sequencer: Chain multiple actions from a single user query
  - ATP Integration: Ready for agent tokenization
- **Extended Plugin System**: Create custom plugins with improved utilities and helpers

### For IQAI ATP Users

If you're planning to tokenize your agents through IQAI's ATP platform, Brain Framework is the recommended choice for development. It provides seamless integration with the ATP ecosystem while maintaining full flexibility for standalone use.
